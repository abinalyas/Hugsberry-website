# Testimonial Photos Setup

## Current Setup

The testimonials section is now configured to use local photos of Indian mothers instead of random avatars.

## Required Images

You need to add **3 photos** of Indian mothers to the `public/images/` folder with these exact names:

1. **testimonial-1.jpg** - For Anu Menon (Mom in Kochi)
2. **testimonial-2.jpg** - For Radhika Iyer (Mom in Mumbai)  
3. **testimonial-3.jpg** - For Neha Gupta (New Mom, Delhi)

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Square images work best (e.g., 200x200px or 400x400px)
- **Style**: Professional, friendly photos of Indian mothers
- **Content**: Headshot or portrait-style photos
- **Location**: Add to `public/images/` folder

## Where to Get Photos

### Option 1: Your Own Photos (Recommended)
- Use photos of real customers (with their permission)
- Use stock photos from:
  - Unsplash (free, high-quality): Search for "Indian woman portrait" or "Indian mother"
  - Pexels (free): Search for "Indian woman" or "Indian mom"
  - Getty Images / Shutterstock (paid): More professional options

### Option 2: Free Stock Photo Sites
Search for these terms:
- "Indian woman portrait"
- "Indian mother smiling"
- "South Asian woman"
- "Indian mom headshot"

**Recommended free stock photo sites:**
- [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) - Search: "Indian woman"
- [Pexels.com](https://pexels.com) - Search: "Indian mother"
- [Pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com) - Search: "Indian woman portrait"

### Option 3: Use AI-Generated Photos
- Use AI image generators (with appropriate licensing)
- Ensure photos look authentic and diverse

## After Adding Photos

Once you add the photos to `public/images/`:
1. The testimonials will automatically display them
2. Photos will be circular (rounded-full)
3. Optimized for mobile and desktop

## Image Optimization Tips

- **Size**: Keep images under 500KB for faster loading
- **Dimensions**: Square format (1:1 aspect ratio) works best
- **Quality**: Good resolution (at least 200x200px, ideally 400x400px)
- **Format**: JPG for photos (smaller file size)

## Current Testimonial Names & Roles

1. **Anu Menon** - "Mom in Kochi"
2. **Radhika Iyer** - "Mom in Mumbai"
3. **Neha Gupta** - "New Mom, Delhi"

The photos should match the names/cities if possible (e.g., woman in traditional Kerala clothing for Kochi).

## Quick Setup

1. Find 3 photos of Indian mothers
2. Name them: `testimonial-1.jpg`, `testimonial-2.jpg`, `testimonial-3.jpg`
3. Place them in: `public/images/` folder
4. They'll automatically appear in the testimonials section!

## Note

If photos are not added yet, the images will show as broken/404. Once you add the photos, they'll display correctly.
